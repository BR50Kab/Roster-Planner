# Welcome to the WaalbrugWire Roster-PLanner repository.

# Description project Roster-Planner

# In order to be able to make a fast employee shift schedule of a hospital department a dedicated Roster-Planner application is being 'developed'.
# Roster-Planner has been derived from Optaplanner available on https://www.optaplanner.org # Especially the Employee Nurse Rostering source is used. The optaplanner is an open source lightweight,  embeddable constraint satisfaction engine which optimizes planning problems.
# De application runs (offline) on Windows and Apple Mac OSX and Linux platforms. The software is written in Java TM. The Roster-planner, as generates solutions based on constraints, which have to be evaluated. Drools, a Business Rules Management System (BRMS)  can be of great help for evaluating the generated solutions (hard/soft constraints).
# The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is being adjusted. 
# Also we are working on the rules in Drools.
